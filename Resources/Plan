We are going to use:
    - PyAutoGUI -> To actually do the playing.
    - mss -> To capture video data fast.
    - OpenCV -> For computer vision.
    - pytesseract -> For reading off of the reload counter.
    - pynput -> For mouse event listeners.
    - subprocess -> For firing up and shutting down Blitz.
    - ctypes/wintypes -> For simulating keyboard/mouse inputs.
    - random -> Randomize decisions.

We need to:
    - Filter particular colors on the screen:
        - Map player icon.
        - Menu/Store -> Container notification
        - Keys on the On-Screen keyboard.
    - Automate:
        - Menu item selection and button execution.
            - Store container icons
            - Before and after battle menu
        - Tank movement:
            - Player icon on map must be isolated.
            - On-Screen Keyboard must be utilized by mouse.
        - Tank shooting:
            - OpenCV for detecting enemy health bars and other GUI

Shooting mechanism:
    How does the automated shooting work? Basically, the program is checking these boolean values:
        1. Reloaded? Check
        2. No bright tomatoes within the shooting area? Check
        3. No dark tomatoes within the shooting area? Check
        4. Aiming reticule aimed? Check
    When all of these are True, then the gun will fire.

Aiming mechanism:
    How does the program aim? Use these properties:
        Program uses CV:
        1. Enemy tanks with respect to the gun.
        Then aim:
        2. Tomatoes with respect to the gun.
    It's all up to the shooting mechanism at this point.

Moving mechanism:
    There're 2 ways to do this. We can use CV to:
        - Recognize the map, and use the map information. -> Formalize strategies
        - Understand the environment with respect to the player tank. -> Use tactics

    If close-combat:
        - Player tank moves back and forth.
        - Player tank circles enemy tank.
    Else:
        - Stop and fire.

Automated menu:
    This is our sequence of events in the garage menu:
        1. Check and click containers in the store.
        2. Automate the process of going into battle. -> Call in_game functions after auto-battle.
        3. (Optional) Check missions and pick tanks.

Automate start up:
    1. Launch Blitz
    2. Call automated menu.
