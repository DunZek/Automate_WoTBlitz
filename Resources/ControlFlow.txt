How does the program work? This is the control flow:

	Start(): 
	- Called from the very start. It's purpose is to start blitz, call auto_menu(), and that's it.
	-> auto_menu()

	Auto_menu():
	- Handles all the usual chores that come with the garage menu.
	- Deals with 2D game objects.
	- Specifically:
		1. Closes News pop-ups.
		2. Check store notification icon -> Check store sub-menu -> Open containers if available -> Return to garage menu.
		3. Checks missions and reads them to decide which tank to use for battle.
		4. Calls in_game().
	-> in_game()

	In_game():
	- Handles all the videogaming stuff.
	- Deals with both 2D and 3D game objects.
	- Specifically:
		1. Handles tank movement. -> auto_move()
		2. Handles gun aiming. -> auto_aim()
		3. Handles shooting.-> auto_shoot()
		4. Calls auto_menu() after a battle. The cycle repeats over again.
	

	Tank behaviour:
	- Handled by auto_move(), auto_aim(), and auto_shoot() all working together.  
	- Specifically:
		- Auto_move(): 
			- deals with the map and the surrounding visual environment to control tank movement.
			- Creates these data:
			    - Visual data from environment.
			    - Visual data from the mini-map.
			- Receives outside info:
				- (boolean) Enemy tank detection.
        - Auto_aim()
            - deals with enemy tank detection, the movement of the cursor and aiming without hitting tomatoes.
            - should be able to focus on one tank when it has detected multiple.
            - Creates these data:
                - X and Y position of enemy tanks
